# I Fought the Law:
# Predicting Outcomes in Virginia's District Courts

## Executive Summary
Each year, millions of hearings are scheduled for Virginia's District Criminal and Traffic Courts, which process charges varying from minor traffic violations to preliminary hearings for serious felonies. For those facing a ticket or charge from the State of Virginia, there is no easy access to data on how others in their shoes have been prosecuted by the state, and how and why defendants are able to overturn or minimize similar charges. A quick search of "should I contest my ticket?" or "should I hire a lawyer?" on the internet returns numerous advice columns and posts from lawyers, many of whom are actively seeking new clients and don't provide concrete data on win rates for their firms or the charges their clients are facing. 

The information imbalance between the State and citizens going through the criminal justice process sets the system up to favor those with the resources to hire seasoned and informed lawyers, and penalize those who can't afford them. For this project, I sought to use historic caseload information from the Virginia Courts database to create data-backed recommendations on defense strategies for people contesting charges in Virginia's 134 districts.

## Problem Statement
> 1. Given data collected on hearings heard in Virginia's District Courts in 2017, how well can we predict the outcome of a case?
> 2. If someone is charged with a crime in Virginia, should they contest the charge? And if so, what factors play the most significant role in determining the outcome of their case?
> 3. With the data we have, is there evidence to suggest racial bias in the Virginia Courts system?
> 4. Is it worth it to hire a private lawyer for your defense (and spend hundreds or thousands of dollars), or is a public defender just as effective?
